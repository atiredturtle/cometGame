This is a game idea i've been playing around with iteratively.

## rules
The goal is to survive as long as possible. You have to avoid the enemies using the arrow keys or WASD. To kill enemies, press the SPACEBAR to fire an EMP. The EMP is charged up by your movement, so the faster you go; the more damage is done.
